> This replication study was part of our evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021

In this replication study, we translate the original matlab code into Julia lang. You will find in this documentation the main function " xxxxx " as well as the intermediary functions we built for this function.
