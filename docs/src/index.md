# Our Replication of Dupuy and Galichon "Personality Traits and the Marriage Market" (2014)

> This replication study was part of our evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021
In this replication study, we translate the original matlab code into Julia lang. You will find in this documentation the main function " AffinityMatrix(df::DataFrame)" as well as the intermediary functions we built for this function.
Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve the last step of optimisation, thereby the AffinityMatrix() function is not operational. 
```@autodocs
Modules = [Dupuy_Galichon_Matching]
```
